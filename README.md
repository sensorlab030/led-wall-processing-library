# Sensor Lab Video Wall Library for Processing

This library is meant to be used with the Sensor Lab Video Wall. It enables people to use the
Processing IDE that they are used to, to run sketches on the Video Wall. What the library does
is stream images over UDP to the Video Wall, which has code to receive UDP images and display them
on the wall.
